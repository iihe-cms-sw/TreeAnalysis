  \class    standalone_LumiReWeighting standalone_LumiReWeighting.h "PhysicsTools/Utilities/interface/standalone_LumiReWeighting.h"
  \brief    Class to provide lumi weighting for analyzers to weight "flat-to-N" MC samples to data

  This class will trivially take two histograms:
  1. The generated "flat-to-N" distributions from a given processing (or any other generated input)
  2. A histogram generated from the "estimatePileup" macro here:

https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/LumiCalc#How_to_use_script_estimatePileup

and produce weights to convert the input distribution (1) to the latter (2).
